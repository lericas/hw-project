# Introduction
My HarvardX Capstone Project focuses on the MovieLens dataset, providing an in-depth 
analysis and insights into movie preferences and ratings. The projectâ€™s aim to 
analyze movie preferences and ratings using the MovieLens dataset1. It emphasizes 
the use of statistical techniques and visualizations to gain insights into user 
and movie rating patterns. The report details the data preprocessing and exploration 
process, including creating a rating matrix and examining rating patterns.

# Methods/analysiS
The project involves data preprocessing and exploration, including creating a 
rating matrix and examining user and movie rating patterns. It utilizes a variety 
of R libraries for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning. We have 
six columns with  8,100,050 rows, where a number of unique users: 69878 and 
unique movies: 10667. 
The summary(train_set$rating) function provides a statistical summary of the rating 
column in the train_set dataframe. Here are the key statistics:

   - Minimum: The lowest rating is 0.5.
   
   - 1st Quartile: 25% of the ratings are below 3.0.
   
   - Median: The middle value of the ratings is 4.0.
   
   - Mean: The average rating is approximately 3.512.
   
   - 3rd Quartile: 75% of the ratings are below 4.0.
   
   - Maximum: The highest rating is 5.0.
   
These statistics give a quick overview of the distribution of movie ratings in the dataset. 
Rating Distribution Graph: This graph is a histogram that displays the frequency 
of movie ratings in the dataset.The x-axis represents the rating value, and the 
y-axis shows the count of ratings.The graph is described as left-skewed, indicating 
that most ratings are above three stars, suggesting a generally positive reception 
of movies in the dataset. 

Average Rating Graphs:
There are two histograms, one for the average rating per movie and another for 
the average rating per user. Both graphs use a bin width of 0.1 to group the average ratings.
The x-axis represents the average rating, and the y-axis indicates the count of 
movies or users that fall into each average rating category. These graphs help to 
visualize the central tendency and dispersion of average ratings among movies and users.

# Results
The RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) scores from the Capstone Project analysis of 
the MovieLens dataset are as follows:

   - Mean-Based Model: The RMSE for the mean-based model on the validation set 
   is 0.9439798279509581.
   
   - Mean Rating Model: The RMSE for the mean rating model on the final hold-out test 
   set is 1.0612022.

   - Linear Regression Model: The RMSE for the linear regression model on the final 
   hold-out test set is 1.061177.

   - XGBoost Model: The RMSE for the XGBoost model on the final hold-out test set 
   is 1.0287993.
   
   - Bias Subtraction Model: The RMSE for the bias subtraction model on the final 
   hold-out test set is 0.89142214.
   
The lowest RMSE score is from the Bias Subtraction Model, which is 0.8914221. 
This indicates that the Bias Subtraction Model has the best predictive accuracy 
among the models evaluated.

# Conclusion The project concludes with the evaluation of different models using 
RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) to determine their accuracy in predicting movie 
ratings, highlighting the performance of the bias subtraction model.

The project involves complex models and large datasets, which are computationally 
demanding and can lead to system crashes on personal laptops with limited resources 
like 8GB RAM.
